# Privacy Policy for Productivity Calendar

**Effective Date:** 20 June 2026  
**Last Updated:** 20 June 2026

## Overview

Productivity Calendar is a **zero-access application** - we have no ability to see, collect, or access your data. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled entirely on your own devices and optionally in your personal cloud storage.

**Key Points:**
- **We cannot access your data** - the app runs entirely on your devices
- **No servers or databases** - we have no infrastructure that could collect data
- **Your data, your control** - stored locally and optionally in your personal Google Drive
- **Google Drive sync is optional** and uses only your own Google account
- **Open source transparency** - verify our privacy claims by reviewing the code

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any information whatsoever.**

### Your Data Stays With You
- **Task Information**: Stored only on your device and optionally in your personal Google Drive
- **Calendar Data**: Never transmitted to us - remains entirely under your control
- **Application Settings**: Saved locally on your device only

### What We Have NO Access To
- Your tasks, calendar data, or any application content
- Personal identifying information
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Device information or technical metrics
- Location data
- Any data for advertising, marketing, or any other purpose

**Important**: We have no servers, databases, or infrastructure that could access your data. The application operates entirely on your devices.

## Zero-Access Architecture

**This application is designed so we cannot access your data even if we wanted to:**

- **No Backend Servers**: We have no servers, databases, or cloud infrastructure
- **No Data Transmission**: Your data never leaves your devices (except to your own Google Drive if you choose)
- **Client-Side Only**: The application runs entirely in your browser or on your desktop
- **No Analytics**: No tracking pixels, usage analytics, or telemetry
- **Open Source Verification**: You can verify these claims by reviewing our source code

This architecture provides the strongest possible privacy protection - **true data sovereignty**.

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage (Primary)
- **Web Version**: Data is stored in your browser's localStorage
- **Desktop Version**: Data is stored in local application files on your device
- **Your Control**: You can clear this data anytime through your browser settings or by uninstalling the desktop app

### Google Drive Sync (Optional)
- **User Choice**: Google Drive integration is completely optional
- **Your Google Drive**: If enabled, data is stored only in your personal Google Drive account
- **App-Only Access**: We only access files that our application creates - never your other Google Drive files
- **Google's Privacy**: When using Google Drive, Google's privacy policy also applies to data stored there

## Google Drive Integration Details

### What We Access
- Permission to create and modify only files created by our application

### How It Works
- You explicitly authorize our app through Google's secure OAuth process
- Data is encrypted in transit to and from Google Drive
- You can revoke access anytime through your Google Account settings
- Disconnecting sync doesn't delete your local data

### Google's Role
- Google provides the storage infrastructure when you choose to sync
- Google's Privacy Policy governs how they handle data in your Google Drive
- We don't share your data with Google beyond what's necessary for the sync feature

## Data Usage

**We do not use your data because we cannot access it.**

Your data is used solely by the application running on your devices to:
- Display your tasks and calendar information

Since we have no access to your data, we cannot and do not:
- Analyze your data for insights or trends
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Sell or monetize your personal information
- Store your data on our servers (we have none)

## Data Sharing

- On your local devices
- In your personal Google Drive (if you choose to sync)
- Never transmitted to our servers or third parties

## Your Rights and Controls

### Data Access
- You have complete access to all your data at all times

### Data Portability
- Export all your data in standard JSON format

## Security Measures

### Local Security

### Sync Security
- All data transmission to Google Drive uses HTTPS encryption

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

**We do not process your personal data** because we have no access to it. 

For users in the European Union:
- **No data processing by us**: The application processes data locally on your device for functionality
- **Google Drive (if enabled)**: Governed by Google's privacy policy and your consent to Google's services
- **Local processing**: Your device processes your own data under your direct control

## Your GDPR Rights

Since we have no access to your personal data, you exercise these rights directly:

- **Access**: You have complete access to all your data in the application
- **Rectify**: You can edit and correct your data anytime in the app
- **Erase**: You can delete your data through the app or by clearing browser storage
- **Restrict processing**: You control all data processing by using or not using features
- **Data portability**: Export your data as JSON files anytime
- **Object to processing**: You control all processing by using the application as you choose
- **Withdraw consent**: For Google Drive features, disconnect sync or revoke Google permissions

**Note**: Since we cannot access your data, you don't need to contact us to exercise these rights - you have direct control.
